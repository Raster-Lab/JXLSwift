## Architecture-Specific Code Separation Plan

The project maintains strict separation of architecture-specific and GPU-specific code to allow independent removal of any acceleration path:

```
Sources/JXLSwift/
├── Core/           ← Architecture-independent (always kept)
├── Encoding/       ← Architecture-independent algorithms
├── Hardware/
│   ├── Accelerate.swift    ← #if canImport(Accelerate) guarded
│   ├── ARM/                ← #if arch(arm64) guarded (removable)
│   │   ├── NEONOps.swift
│   │   └── NEONDct.swift
│   ├── x86/                ← #if arch(x86_64) guarded (removable)
│   │   ├── SSEOps.swift
│   │   ├── AVXOps.swift
│   │   └── SSEDct.swift
│   ├── Metal/              ← #if canImport(Metal) guarded (Apple GPU, removable)
│   │   ├── MetalOps.swift
│   │   ├── MetalCompute.swift
│   │   └── Shaders.metal
│   └── Vulkan/             ← #if canImport(Vulkan) guarded (Linux/Windows GPU, removable)
│       ├── VulkanOps.swift
│       ├── VulkanCompute.swift
│       └── Shaders.comp
├── Format/         ← Architecture-independent
└── Export/         ← Architecture-independent
```

**Removal process:**
- **ARM NEON:** Delete `Hardware/ARM/` and remove `#if arch(arm64)` branches.
- **x86-64 SIMD:** Delete `Hardware/x86/` and remove `#elseif arch(x86_64)` branches.
- **Metal GPU:** Delete `Hardware/Metal/` and remove `#if canImport(Metal)` branches.
- **Vulkan GPU:** Delete `Hardware/Vulkan/` and remove `#if canImport(Vulkan)` branches.

The `#else` fallback (scalar) implementations remain as universal fallbacks in all cases.

## Dependency Policy

| Dependency | Purpose | Required | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Foundation | Core types, Data, Date | Yes | Apple platform standard |
| Accelerate | vDSP, vImage | Optional | `#if canImport(Accelerate)` |
| Metal | GPU compute (Apple) | Optional | `#if canImport(Metal)` |
| Vulkan | GPU compute (Linux/Windows) | Optional | `#if canImport(Vulkan)` (Milestone 16) |
| ArgumentParser | CLI argument parsing | jxl-tool only | Swift Package dependency |
| XCTest | Unit testing | Tests only | Standard testing framework |
| libjxl | Reference comparison | Benchmarks only | External C++ library |

**Zero runtime C/C++ dependencies** for the core library. Vulkan support requires the Vulkan SDK on non-Apple platforms.
