## Architecture-Specific Code Separation Plan

The project maintains strict separation of architecture-specific code to allow future removal of x86-64 support:

```
Sources/JXLSwift/
├── Core/           ← Architecture-independent (always kept)
├── Encoding/       ← Architecture-independent algorithms
├── Hardware/
│   ├── Accelerate.swift    ← #if canImport(Accelerate) guarded
│   ├── ARM/                ← #if arch(arm64) guarded (future)
│   │   ├── NEONOps.swift
│   │   └── NEONDct.swift
│   └── x86/                ← #if arch(x86_64) guarded (removable)
│       ├── AVXOps.swift
│       └── SSEDct.swift
└── Format/         ← Architecture-independent
```

**Removal process:** Delete the `Hardware/x86/` directory and remove `#elseif arch(x86_64)` branches. The `#else` fallback (scalar) implementations remain as universal fallbacks.
